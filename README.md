# MenoMoni-HealthcareHackathon
This is the repository for the MenoMoni concept that was created during the Healthcare Hackathon.

## App Prototype
We created a prototype to check if the desired functionality of our concept can be realized as an app. The prototype contains the following features:
<ul>
  <li>Profile Creation</li>
  <li>Read/Write from/to Health Connect on Android</li>
  <li>Read/create calender entries from the smartphone</li>
  <li>Send of customized prompts to the meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct from NVIDIA</li>
</ul>

It was created using the Flutter framework from Google.

### Usage Notes
Before the usage of the prototype you must paste in your NVIDIA API Key to the llm_communication_client.dart file.

### Dependencies
The following libraries were used and are integrated within the app for the realization of the prototype:
<ul>
  <li>cupertino_icons: Version 1.0.8 (integrated within the default prototype of flutter)</li>
  <li>device_calendar: Version 4.3.3 (link: https://pub.dev/packages/device_calendar)</li>
